# lionel2-exploits
# A public collection of all the ways lionel is a not so secure website. 

This repo contains various methods of accessing vast amounts of data lionel has stored. Photos, names, student IDs, schedules, class lists and formative feedback can all be collected with one session ID. Note that none of my methods use any session hjacking or anything. Most of the information needs to be publicly available (a lot of it doesn't, though). They just haven't done a very good job at rate limiting requests or preventing a random student such as myself from accessing it all in one go. 

All methods will only require your own session ID (except for schedules, which don't even need that). Even if you are getting your friend's schedule or photo, your own session ID will work as long as it is valid. 


Current available data with my methods (as of september 2022):
- Photos
- Names
- Ids (Used to get the data of a specific person)
- Schedules
- Class lists
- Formative Feedback


If you have feedback, potential new methods or any comments at all feel free to reach out to me (climia1@kgv.hk or climiealex@gmail.com) or just create a PR.
