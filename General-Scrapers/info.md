These scrapers are based on the forum system the IT department implemented but never fully finished/rolled out. On this page, you can access a list of every student by setting the profile per page to 2000+ in the url. It is then fairly easy to parse and get student information. 

For teachers, it is a tad harder, though still very easy. Students don't have any tags in common with teachers (aside from class tags, but those only work for specific teachers) so you need to manually go through approximately 1000 pages as the teacher profiles themselves are, of course, unprotected. 

Scripts only need your moodle session id.
